# beaver – Project Vision

beaver is a braille-first, terminal-only computing platform
built on Raspberry Pi OS Lite.

Design principles:
- Deterministic behavior
- Text-first interaction
- No GUI dependency
- Offline-capable
- Explicit user control
- Braille works from boot
- User data survives upgrades

Non-goals:
- Desktop environments
- Screen reader GUIs
- Implicit background services
- Automatic “smart” behavior
